## 👨‍💻 About Me

With a degree in computer science, my journey began at Redpawns, working on test automation solutions powered by NLP and machine learning. As a front-end developer at Creysto, I built and scaled the front end of their in-house CRM web app, leading projects and managing a team. After relocating to Canada, I completed a software development boot camp at BrainStation and honed my skills in React.js, Express.js, and Knex.js.

I'm always open to new opportunities and collaborations. Let's create something amazing together!
